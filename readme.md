Jeevan.Data is a virtual health-assistant able to predict diseases using ML, storing medical records and curating 
healthcare articles along with a doctor-patient interaction facility.

# Overview

We plan to create an ecosystem where patients can store their medical history and
enable digitalisation of medical records and be a carrier in the government of
India’s ayushman bharat yojana. We plan to shift Indian patients on preventive
healthcare using AI-based algorithms which can identify various diseases like Skin
Cancer, Covid-19, Retinal Diseases,Pneumonia,etc. in advance and will prompt the user to visit the doctor.
This will help in reducing medical bills of patients and will help them to live a better
life. This ecosystem will also reduce the burden on the medical infrastructure and
doctors of our country.

Currently, a standard government hospital or local healthcare facility is unable to uniformly document all
records for services.This creates issues such as requirement of repeated diagnostic tests and consultations,
delayed treatments, concealment or ignorance of medical history etc.Even in hospitals where digital records
are maintained, there is no provision of electronic transfer of patient records from one service provider to
another. Using Jeevan.Data, a patient will be able to keep track of their health records and will be able to
access them on the go. We plan to increase awareness by making healthcare-related articles available daily in 
the app.

# Features Implemented

1. Users can login and upload image to diagnose.
1. Able to instantly diagnose Covid-19,  Pneumonia, 3 types of Skin-Cancer, 46 types of Retinal Diseases with over 90% accuracy.
2. Curated Healthcare Articles available in regional languages daily.
3. Stores and digitises medical records.
4. Displays contact info of specialist Doctor.
