# Overview

We plan to create an ecosystem where patients can store their medical history and
enable digitalisation of medical records and be a carrier in the government of
Indiaâ€™s ayushman bharat yojana. We plan to shift Indian patients on preventive
healthcare using AI-based algorithms which can identify various diseases like Skin
Cancer, Covid-19, Retinal Diseases,Pneumonia,etc. in advance and will prompt the user to visit the doctor.
This will help in reducing medical bills of patients and will help them to live a better
